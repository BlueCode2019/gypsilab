# gypsiLab
The GypsiLab project is a young open-sources matlab toolbox for fast numerical computation 
with finite element and boundary element methods. Accessible with an high level programming 
langage, it's give a usefull framework for fast prototyping. Initially designed for numerical
acoustics, multiphysics problems can now be adressed. 

   GypsiLab is divided in five parts :
 
 - OpenMSH : Library for mesh management and numerical quadrature. Designed by 
 Matthieu Aussal, Ecole Polytechnique.
 
 - OpenFEM : Library for Finite element method. Designed by 
 Matthieu Aussal, Ecole Polytechnique
 Fran√ßois Alouges, Ecole Polytechnique
 
 - OpenHmX : Library for H-Matrix computation and algebra. Designed by 
 Matthieu Aussal, Ecole Polytechnique
 
  - NonRegressionTest : Scripts for non regression testing. Usefull to evaluate
 performance and verify computation.
 
  - Problems : Scripts with standards problems to first step in gypsilab. 
 
Current version is 0.2.
