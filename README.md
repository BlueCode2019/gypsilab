# gypsiLab
The GypsiLab project is a young open-sources matlab toolbox for fast numerical computation with finite element and boundary element methods. Accessible with an high level programming langage, it's give a usefull framework for fast prototyping. Initially designed for numerical acoustics, multiphysics problems can now be adressed. 

   GypsiLab is divided in five parts :
 
 - <b> OpenFEM </b> : Library for Finite Element Method.
</br> <i>By Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique) and François Alouges (Ecole Polytechnique) </i>
 
 - <b> OpenHmX </b>  : Library for H-Matrix computation and algebra.
 </br> <i> By Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique) </i>
 
 - <b> OpenMSH </b>  : Library for mesh management and numerical quadrature.  
 </br> <i> By Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique) </i>
 
 - <b>NonRegressionTest</b> : Scripts for non regression testing. Usefull to evaluate
 performance and verify computation.
 
 - <b>Problems</b> : Scripts with standards problems to first step in gypsilab.
