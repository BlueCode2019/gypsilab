# gypsiLab
The GypsiLab project is a young open-sources matlab toolbox for fast numerical computation with finite element and boundary element methods. Accessible with an high level programming langage, it's give a usefull framework for fast prototyping. Initially designed for numerical acoustics, multiphysics problems can now be adressed. 

   GypsiLab is divided in five parts :
 
 - OpenFEM : Library for Finite element method.
 Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique)
 François Alouges (Ecole Polytechnique)
 
 - OpenHmX : Library for H-Matrix computation and algebra.
 Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique)
 
 - OpenMSH : Library for mesh management and numerical quadrature.  
 Matthieu Aussal (Ecole Polytechnique)
 
 - NonRegressionTest : Scripts for non regression testing. Usefull to evaluate
 performance and verify computation.
 
 - Problems : Scripts with standards problems to first step in gypsilab.
